Basics of GitHub:
  The main strength of GitHub is that you can make a "branch" of the main project. This new branch can then be edited without causing harm to the main branch. Once you have finished all of your edits, you can then ask to merge your branch with the main branch. Once someone goes through it and makes sure everything is good to go, anyone can merge the branch and essentially add your changes to the main branch.

Disaster Recovery:
  After every edit, branch, merge, or almost anything else, GitHub saves a version of the project that we can revert back too. Where the majority of issues will arise will be when we merge branches to the main branch. Luckily, there is an easy way to revert the change and sometimes restore the broken branch. To do this, go to the pull request for that branch and either click "Revert" to un-commit the branch or click "Restore Branch" to un-delete the branch. These two options are probably going to be the most important, but you can always look for help in the help page (https://help.github.com/) if there is something that requires more than these two buttons to fix.
